# CC Trello Board - User Journey

## Problem Sensing (pre-Trello)

Source and prioritize 1 problem your group has.

* What methods to use to do that within your group?
* Victor: Miro board for brainstorming and problem sensing, ranked voting for problem prioritization.
* Create ticket + Assign yourself as “problem owner” for that problem.
* Move problem to “Problem Backlog”

### Problem Backlog

* Write the problem in structured form - ask at least one CC member for feedback
* Input the problem into the “Problem backlog” section of the Trello board (1 from each group)
* Schedule a time during the CC to present the problem and solicit feedback from Circle members.
* Move the problem to the “360 feedback” section.

### 360 Feedback

### Prepare a 10m presentation reviewing the problem.

* Receive feedback from Circle members and modify problem statement if needed.
* Move to the “well-defined problems” area.

### Well-Defined Problems (Ready)

* Schedule time to present the problem during Town Hall&#x20;
* Define solving strategy with Circle (Presentation? Challenge? Proposal? Facilitate problem solving sessions?)
* Prepare a presentation. Present it.&#x20;
* Move to “Shared with Community” section

### Shared with Community

* Track teams who are addressing the issue.
* Once one or more teams pick up the challenge to address it, or direct action from CC is initiated move to “Picked up” section

### Picked Up (Ready)

* Create a ticket for each solution + assign ID number to solution.
* Once a prototype for a solution has been created, move to the “prototyping” section.

### Prototyping (In Progress)

* Once a pilot achieves results, move to validation.

### Validation (Reporting)

* Prepare presentation of outcomes of the prototype to present to the circle.
* Circle decided whether they consider the problem solved/ Have recommendations for a follow up pilot/ Recommend this methodology to be incorporated in the “main Catalyst process” or reject it, but include what was learned from the experiment.
* Problem owner presents the solution, what we learned and next steps to the community.
* If the solution was integrated, move to the integrated section.
* If the solution was rejected, either move back to prototyping or to the lessons learned column.

### Integrated (Accepted)

* Review when onboarding the next Circle members, the various ways is which problems were addressed.

### Lessons learned (Canceled)

* Review when onboarding the next Circle members, how the community tried to solve a problem, and what we learned from it.

### Circle reset

* Community groups are asked whether they want to continue with the problem or choose a new one.
* All “abandoned” problems get archived, and Trello gets reset anew for the incoming CC.
