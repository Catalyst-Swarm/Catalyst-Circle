# Catalyst Prioritized Problems Trello

## Revised Catalyst Prioritized Problems Trello Board

## Overview

This page embeds Trello Cards & GitHub Issues for each **Prioritized Problem** Circle is working on and dispalys the current staus of the probelm.

It follows the guidelines for a revised user journey presented by Dor Garbash and Victor Corcino at [Circle Meeting 5](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/meetings/meeting-5-september-9th-2021#00-15-trello-board-guidelines-dor-and-victor-10-min) on 9th September 2021.

Each embedded **Trello Card** displays the category label \(e.g. Trust & Merit\), the problem description and the journey stage, called _list_ in Trello \(e.g. 360 Feedback\).

Beneath each Trello Card is a copy in GitHub Issue format. There is also a two way link between Trello Card and GitHub Issue. The GitHub Issue allows for more extensive documentation to be added, for Prioritized Problems to be associated with particular events such as meetings and for anyone with a GitHub account to comment and copy.

## Trust & Merit

### CA: There is no reputation/merit system for CAs/vCA, and CAs/vCAs ratings are all weighted in the same way.
