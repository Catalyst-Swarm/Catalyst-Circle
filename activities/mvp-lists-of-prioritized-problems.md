## Prioritized Problems

## Community Advisors

### Problem 1:

* What problem do you see?
  * CAs and vCAs rewarding system does not incentivize higher assessments quality (CAs) or higher number of assessment reviews (vCAs).
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * Current rewarding system incentivizes quantity instead of quality in CAs assessments, which might lead to unfair scores, and does not incentivize high engagement of vCAs, which is unfair and harms the assessment QA phase.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Current state: as described in the problem statement. Expected state: change the rewarding system so it rewards CAs based on assessment's quality, and rewards vCAs in a fairer and more engaging way.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * Measure the increase in quality of assessments and number of reviews after the change in the rewarding system.

### Problem 2:

* What problem do you see?
  * There is no reputation/merit system for CAs/vCA, and CAs/vCAs ratings are all weighted in the same way.
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * CAs/vCAs with a good track record could have higher positive impact in the Catalyst process in general.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Current state: 'good' and 'bad' CAs/vCAs have the same influence in the final proposal scores. Expected state: CAs/vCAs with good track record influencing more the final proposal scores.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * General improvement on assessments quality and fairness.

## Funded Cohort

### Problem 1:

* What problem do you see?
  * Overwhelming amount of information of Project Catalyst, in particular during onboarding phase (supposing ongoing)
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?

It would lower the entry barrier for newcomers to get involved

Assuming the mission of Catalyst has its origins here:

_Voltaire will be a crucial building block in the Cardano ecosystem, because it allows every ada holder to be involved in making decisions on the future development of the platform and contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. Project Catalyst is the important first component in delivering that capability._

*
  * Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
    * Not in a transparent and sustained quantitative survey results. Suppose a rank from 1 (high compex, overwhelming) to 10 (simplicity and easy to access and understand): ideal goal should be 8-10, assuming we are at 2-3 = gap 6 pts.
  * How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
    * \# of new people subscribe to Ideascale
    * Ratio of engagement vs total people registered in ideascale
    * \# of registered wallets for voting
    * \# of proposals
    * Elevated quality ratings for submitted proposals
    * \# of people taking on a role
    * Average time (months/years) of people being active in roles
    * Well positioned minimum # of channels used to onboard people

### Problem 2:

* What problem do you see?
  * Almost non existing “ collaborative layer” to welcome newcomers
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * Human interaction will help people to engage
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Rate 1 (non existing) to 10 (sufficient formats available): Target 10, rate to date: 2-3; gap: 8 \*subject evaluation
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * \# of new people subscribe to Ideascale
  * Ratio of engagement vs total people registered in ideascale
  * \# of registered wallets for voting
  * \# of proposals
  * Elevated quality ratings for submitted proposals
  * \# of people taking on a role
  * Average time (months/years) of people being active in roles
  * Well positioned relevant # of facilitators with relevant methods and formats to engage with newcomers and guide them

## IOG

### Problem 1:

* What problem do you see?
  * How do we remove IOHK from every decision made in Catalyst? How can we transition from governors to service providers?
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * Decentralization is one of the 3 key goals of governance, and that cannot be achieved with one centrally controlled entity calling the shots.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Current state is IOG is making most decisions in the system except which proposal will receive funding and 50% of the challenges. Envisioned state is that all decisions are made via governance mechanisms that receive explicit consent by ada holders, and under the supervision of the Cardano community. IOG and Catalyst are service providers getting compensated for their contributions to Cardano.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * Make a list of all decisions types and track which have received explicit consent by the community and which is decided in a decentralized way or have community supervision over.

### Problem 2:

* What problem do you see?
  * How does IOHK and Catalyst community coordinate building the developer and governance eco-system effectively? How do we avoid duplications of effort? How do we generate partnerships?
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * ROI is one the 3 key goals of Catalyst. Coordination between IOG, DCF and Catalyst innovation system will increase ROI in two ways: Save duplications of efforts therefore reduce costs, and also finds opportunities to collaborate and launch projects jointly which will increase ROI and utilization of resources.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Current state: IOG and Catalyst pretty much doing their own thing, and once in a while there’s some local feedback between the entities.\
    Desired state: Both IOG and Catalyst have a shared knowledge about the intentions of the other, who is working on what and there’s coordination mechanisms for both sides to initiate partnerships.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * Measure how many joint projects have been created per Fund. Survey funded proposers as well as IOG product/tech leads about their level of awareness and interaction with their counterparts.

## Stake Pool Operators

### Problem 1:

* **What problem do you see?**
  * How to involve “ pure” SPOs in Catalyst Projects
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * We want to educate people who are already involved with Cardano to have a chance to use their knowledge in creating new tools for SPOs.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Currently a major part of SPOs are not involved in any catalyst projects as well their knowledge is mostly non-existent about the opportunities.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)
  * Education / training / having a platform where SPOs can connect with Developers and provide their skill set for new projects.

### Problem 2:

* What problem do you see?
  * Permanent “undefined “ or “Miscellaneous” challenge bucket for projects which don’ t fit in any of the fund predefined buckets.\

* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * Project can be funded without waiting for the correct bucket. Eliminate the potential for a good project to get degraded for not fitting into the current challenge setting.
* Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
  * Current state: A proposal for a potentially good project can be submitted that does not fit into the current challenge settings only to be downgraded in the ratings and not receive funding.
  * Envisioned state: With an "undefined" challenge setting we will see more accurately rated projects, proposals for projects that benefit the ecosystem without the need to be tailored to a challenge they do not fit in, and ultimately a lower barrier of entry for projects that will also not need to wait several funding rounds to be proposed under the right challenge setting.
* How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? (optional)

### Problem 3:

* What problem do you see?
  * Have opportunity to apply for recurring funding
* Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?
  * Project continuity - when a product is delivered to the market, it needs to be updated / upgraded. After the funds run out - either the project has to apply for new funds or make the product commercial (or just close the project)

### Problem 1:

* **What problem do you see?**
* **Onboarding & Introduction**
  * There is an overload of information for Cardano and Catalyst, it is very dispersed and therefore hard for someone just starting out to know where to look and learn how to participate. People feel overwhelmed and lost when first starting out.
  * Much of the available materials are in English only. Different communities do not have bridges between each other. This adds friction to world domination! Slowing down our ability to connect as a cohesive community and gain momentum.
* **Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?**
  * Diverse engaged and informed community participation is vital for Catalyst to be successful. We want to build a vibrant creative community able to sense local needs and act upon them collectively. Sense locally, act globally.
  * The amount of information available about Cardano and Catalyst will only continue to grow as more people join the community. Improving findability creates a reinforcing feedback loop which in itself becomes a super-power. The process of getting connected will only get more difficult, without a way to aggregate and streamline information. We need to give people orientation and confidence to contribute to the ecosystem.
* **Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?**
  * **Yes :)**
  * To find what I need when I need it and be able to work with who I need to work with.
  * Any gap must be filled by us as humans to focus on what matters most individually; Specialization with a method toward awareness of what is happening around us.
  * Many different communities can flourish in Cardano. It is hard to know where they are and where to start. In the “Experiment” there is an overwhelming amount of information for new people to digest. Scattered in a large number of places. We’re achieving a lot, however keeping up is exhausting.
  * Having mechanisms to separate the signal from the noise. Mechanisms and information to bring people into the community in a safe and inclusive way are important. To be able to create new knowledge and merge that with the collective intelligence of Cardano. Markets are after all, conversations.
  * To build the communities we need, we need to sow radicles 🌱 so that we can work together effectively.

### Problem 2: Trust, Participation, and Reward system(s)

* **What problem do you see?**
  * As the community grows larger it becomes harder for people to establish direct connections. Knowing who to trust, who delivers value, and what expertise other people bring to the table becomes important.
  * The key problem is related to building the next layer of trust.
  * For example, one person stated, "I do not know who to trust for engagement, mentorship, technical expertise." The flip-side is people need to be able to build a sustainable livelihood in the ecosystem if Cardano is to flourish.
  * As a community, we don't have any way to reward community participation and contribution. People participate and contribute to the greater Catalyst community; In chat rooms, meetings, events and other forums where time, energy, and enthusiasm are routinely on display. This effort is not acknowledged or rewarded. We don’t want to create sweatshops.
* **Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst?**
  * Creating honest trustworthy signals becomes important for the growth of our ecosystem.
  * A certain level of altruism and passion are needed for the community to flourish, but taken to an extreme it is not sustainable long term. Egalitarianism verses slavery. Having a mechanism for the community to state what is valued, track contributions, and reward those that participate and provide value will be key in growing the community and keeping people engaged over the long term.
  * As the community grows, knowing who to trust and who has expertise in specific areas will allow people to safely express their preferences and also delegate to respected experts.
  * Knowing who to trust in different scenarios will allow people to collaborate effectively with the best possible individuals, projects and teams.
* **Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?**
  * There are currently many emergent systems in operation to assess proposals; however, their utility has not been proven nor their behavior well characterized.
  * Working on projects which are unfunded or under-resourced because of inadequate information is not sustainable either. Ultimately we want to give super-powers to people and ideas.
  * Creating reputation and reward systems are complex and must balance extrinsic reward with intrinsic motivation. Defining these components is a difficult undertaking but amplifies and focuses effort. Data and the construction of honest signals are required. Ideally modelled and evolved based on empirical evidence to move forward.
  * Proactive funding via proposals tends to favour certainty over outcome. Yet navigating uncharted territory needs explorers and some continuity of funding for productive engagement in the ecosystem.
  * The future state gives the Cardano ecosystem a veritable treasure chest of primitives for building and navigating our space together.

**NOTE**: To further assist the Catalyst Circle members, Governance Alive has compiled a list of options that representatives may want to reference when gathering problem statements from your communities, if desired. This list is certainly not exhaustive, and members are not constrained to use any technique(s) on this list. No expectations are set with the document, just a reference if you would like some inspiration.
