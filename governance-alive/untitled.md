## Document Transcription

## Catalyst Circle Aim

 In the meeting on [July 12, 2021](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/meetings/july-12th-2021), the Catalyst Circle made the following decision:

**DECISION**: For next meeting members will be prepared to: 

\(1\) share a list of the problems within your group. Problem statement rubrik o What problem do you see?

Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst? 

 Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?  How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? \(optional\) 

\(2\) Rank the problems \(focus on top two statements\)

\(3\) Share our feedback with each other and look for problem statements to solve together \(eg. join with another member - eg Victor, Juli, Felix\)

\(4\) Place Problems in accessible backlog tool \(E.g Trello\)

### Note

NOTE: To further assist the Catalyst Circle members, Governance Alive has compiled a list of options that representatives may want to reference when gathering problem statements from your communities, if desired. This list is certainly not exhaustive, and members are not constrained to use any technique\(s\) on this list. No expectations are set with the document, just a reference if you would like some inspiration.

## About the Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\) Approach

Whatever we can do now is good enough, and below is why.

### About Prototyping

### The Background Science

Brains work primarily as a “difference engine.”

To minimize the cognitive load of processing information, brains will ignore anything that it expects to see. For example, when you look around the room, if your brain expects the furniture to be in a particular location, it will only recognize items that are unexpectedly out-of-place.

As a result, anything that we expect to happen will often be ignored by the brain!

WARNING: This means that some of the most-important information may not be immediately accessible, specifically because it is experienced frequently.

### The Antidote

The goal of “Prototyping” is to create a visual representation for review and analysis, sometimes called a “straw man” or a “prototype”. It does not have to be complete, and is sometimes more effective when it is not complete. The presentation of the prototype allows participants to use the difference engine in their brain to identify what is missing, fill in the gaps, and remember the things that are hard to remember because they are experienced frequently

### Recommendation

Setup a limit to the amount of time spent on initial brainstorming in order to create a prototype. Then let people pick apart the prototype and identify what is missing or inaccurate.

### About Brainstorming vs Sorting

### Tip \#1: Collect ideas and suggestions separately from the sorting of the same ideas

CAUTION: Hold brainstorming activities and sorting activities in separate stages instead of mixing the two activities.

 The Background Science: The functions used in the brain for generating new ideas and sorting through ideas are different, leveraging activating and inhibiting neurons, respectively. Elisting the inhibiting neurons too early can actually physically block the formation of new ideas. 

\(You may have heard the phrase “there are no bad ideas” as an intention to foster this approach. Employing the sorting part of our brain too early can interrupt the forming of new connections and hinder the process.\) 

“Not every idea will be a great idea, but a great idea can come from anywhere” - The Ratatouille Principle \(based on the Pixar movie\)

### Tip \#2: Embrace the fact that some people are better at brainstorming, and others at sorting 

Suggestion: Allow people to participate according to their strengths. Don’t require everyone to brainstorm, or everyone to sort. Some will be more naturally inclined to one activity or the other.

## The Definition of Viable

For an item to be Viable, it must be:

### Desirable

 People must care about the item and want to engage. Usually you can measure the amount of engagement through observing the emotional impact of each item on the potential audience.

### Feasible 

It must be possible for the item to be accomplished technologically, logistically, and financially. If there are any potential blocks to success, the item is said to be at risk. • 

### Scalable

The item needs to be usable as part of a system. If it requires a large amount of activity and personal interaction to succeed, the item can not be delivered at scale in a population larger than a few hundred people.

## About Iterating

Once you have made a change, iterate. Iteration is the process of incremental improvement- when we understand problems through this lens we open ourselves to creativity. This allows for our first capture of the problem to blossom into a detailed understanding of the problem. There is never just one MVP. The Minimum Viable Product is an iterative process resulting in multiple successive MVPs.

## Library of Techniques

### Techniques for Identifying Problems

#### [Card Sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/learn/101s/card-sorting/)

Brainstorm a list of ideas in three \(3\) categories: 

1\) What's gone well?

2\) What's gone badly? \(i.e. danger signals\)

3\) What's interesting? o You can optionally prioritize cards by moving more-important cards to the top of each list

This can be done by select individuals or in “round robin” with each person getting a chance to move a card higher or lower in the list in rotation. 

Works well with a Miro board

Very mental

#### [Kepner-Tregoe](https://www.mathscinotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kepner-Tregoe_Methodology_version_2_20130307.pdf)

Describe what’s working well

Describe what’s not working well

What is the difference between the two?

What could be the cause of the difference?

The causes become your problem statements

#### Uncovering Direction

Inspiration - What inspires participants?

Tensions - What feels wrong to participants?

Capacity - Given where we are right now, which steps to develop our inspirations or relieve our tensions are within our capacity?
