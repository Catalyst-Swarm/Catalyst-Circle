# Governance Alive

## Catalyst Circle Aim

 In the meeting on July 12, 2021, the Catalyst Circle made the following decision:

DECISION: For next meeting members will be prepared to: 

\(1\) share a list of the problems within your group. Problem statement rubrik o What problem do you see?

Why is solving this problem important to the mission of Project Catalyst? 

 Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?  How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured? \(optional\) 

\(2\) Rank the problems \(focus on top two statements\)

\(3\) Share our feedback with each other and look for problem statements to solve together \(eg. join with another member - eg Victor, Juli, Felix\)

\(4\) Place Problems in accessible backlog tool \(E.g Trello\)

### Note

NOTE: To further assist the Catalyst Circle members, Governance Alive has compiled a list of options that representatives may want to reference when gathering problem statements from your communities, if desired. This list is certainly not exhaustive, and members are not constrained to use any technique\(s\) on this list. No expectations are set with the document, just a reference if you would like some inspiration.

## About the Minimum Viable Product \(MVP\) Approach

Whatever we can do now is good enough, and below is why.

### About Prototyping

#### The Background Science

Brains work primarily as a “difference engine.”

To minimize the cognitive load of processing information, brains will ignore anything that it expects to see. For example, when you look around the room, if your brain expects the furniture to be in a particular location, it will only recognize items that are unexpectedly out-of-place.

As a result, anything that we expect to happen will often be ignored by the brain!

WARNING: This means that some of the most-important information may not be immediately accessible, specifically because it is experienced frequently.
