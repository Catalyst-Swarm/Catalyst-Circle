Dear Circle. For Circle Meeting 3, rather than 10 minutes to import a google document - it took me over an hour and half to transcribe content in various locations. This is not sustainable and has resulted in a drop in presentation quality. This would not matter so much if this was a workshop - but this is a Catalyst Circle meeting, and it has now become very difficult to document and track Circle. Circle documentation in general is becoming confusing and inaccessible to the general user. May I suggest the following: 

1\) Create a Google Drive where everyone has read-only access 

2\) Create separate documents for each meeting – composite documents blur the lines between each meeting, are confusing to read because there are no digestible sections and take additional time to transcribe \(this is very frustrating\). In my view a Circle Meeting document should be the record of note for the community on a specific date/time. 

3\) Create separate dated documents for raised Agenda Items. 

4\) Circle needs to decide how they want to track and document materials they continuously work on. Does Circle want the progress of a document tracked \(this can provide a useful audit trail of lessons learnt\) or will the document be an “end product” ? 

5\) Bear in mind that content within a Miro Board is not practically trackable. Using Miro for meeting documentation renders it inaccessible. It is possible to take a snapshot of a complete board – but this provides no granularity at all. 

6\) Circle should take time at each meeting to consider how you summarise and explain what you do to the community. These are my impressions after documenting and tracking Circle from the beginning. I understand that everything we do is a work in progress and I offer these comments in that spirit.
