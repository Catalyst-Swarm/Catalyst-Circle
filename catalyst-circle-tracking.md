# Catalyst Circle Tracking

In order to provide complete transparency the activities of the Catalyst Circle can now be tracked by Catalyst Community GitHub maintainers. This is meant to provide oversight on the Catalyst Circle and its processes only.

## Catalyst-Circle Tracking - Project Board

Every Catalyst-Circle event will be raised as a GitHub Issue and placed in the [Catalyst-Circle Tracking Project Board](https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/projects/2).
