# Catalyst Circle Overview

## Definition

The Catalyst Circle is a “human sensor array” that monitors the current state and future plans regarding governance in Project Catalyst. The Circle detects and discusses concerns, objections and opportunities arising within the Catalyst eco-system. The activity outputs a transparent view into the hopes, wants, needs and concerns of the community, IOG and CF with project Catalyst.  
It is also responsible for defining the election processes for Catalyst Circle V2.

This is a first iteration of an experiment in project Catalyst governance - likely to change and evolve from iteration to iteration.

## Goals

* Facilitate the different functional groups in Catalyst to communicate with each other.
* Provide a heads-up when any red lines are crossed within a certain group.
* Suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst.
* Define the election process for the Catalyst Circle V2.
