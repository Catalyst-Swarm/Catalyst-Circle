#### **Content Agenda \(start 0:08\)**

#### Introductions

#### Discussion on purpose of Catalyst Circle Facilitators and Secretary team

{% hint style="info" %}
Propose a discussion on roles and responsibility of facilitator, secretary, and team on Friday? \(30m might not be enough for this meeting\)
{% endhint %}

**Nadim** - Is traveling and trying to keep up to date when he can. Interested in how the facilitator/secretary roles chase.

**Charlie**  - We do not have a clear vision of Circle aims. Project Catalyst seems agnostic on setting goals. The current iteration gives me little confidence that much will be delivered. As there is not enough conversation about problems. Also there is a need to define terms like “red lines”. How to define the shape of Catalyst remains open. At Circle Meeting 5 how to define the election process seemed to be sidelined by funding issues ?

**Nadim** - There are a lot of gaps and not a lot not defined. We need to define all this ambiguity, before we are able to transition to some foundation, some stability. We have 3 months to develop something to meet this challenge.

**Nori** - To get the conversation back on track. We have an After Town Hall \(ATH\) Breakout room tonight where we can discuss Circle’s terms of reference. But we are facilitators, we do not guide the vision of Circle, we should be able to give feedback - but we are not responsible for the shaping of Circle. Facilitators should be doing work prior to Circle meetings to identify actions items and to employ a strategy to meet that goal.

**Charlie** - I would suggest facilitation is also the grounding of meaning. We should call-out ambiguity in a meeting and respond in kind.

**Alice** - I liked what Charlie said and I propose an action item - to add higher goals, to facilitate conversation around insights and vision of Circle. To make them more specific.

**Stephen** - During Circle Meeting 5, Dor asked me a question regarding the Trello board process and this broke the fourth wall that is the silent secretary. I was unprepared, but in future the secretary and facilitator should be prepared to give input when called upon.

**Nori** - I do not want this group to insert items in the Circle’s Agenda. Some feedback from Felix on this point would be good

**Nadim**  - We should ask Circle what do you guys need from us ? What are Circles pain points and where do you think we could add value ?
