* Next meeting: proposed for August 12  same time
* Review/accept record of July 12 meeting
* Accept Content Agenda 

### Agenda Considerations

* Timeline \(End of first of 3 months — sprint 2 out of 6\)
* Sociocracy Training Videos \(just-in-time, as needed\)
* Clustering \(Simplify by Grouping Similar Problem Statements\) & Consent
* Enter to Trello
* Prioritizing the Clusters \(use grid known-unknown / energy\)
* Move forward in Trello

### Content Agenda

\(0:17\) Deliberate on proposal to work initially with three clusters - see Miro board

* Dor: Replace “Open, Alternative Category” and call it “Alternative Funding” or “Funding Rigidity”. Group SPO’s problem statement for needing a miscellaneous Challenge category together with Toolmakers Reward System problem statement.
* Juli: Make sure that we are acknowledging the difference between funding and the rewards system. They are currently different.
* Lauris: Add “Awareness” to the “Onboarding” problem cluster

  -Dor: Suggest holding the clusters lightly. Just because the problems are clustered, doesn’t mean that the problems are the same, and the problems should be tracked separately. 

\(0:45\) Option to split into breakout groups that reflect the consented clusters \(open space style\)

* Work together or in breakout rooms to put consented cluster on two-axis grid: known-unknown / low energy - high energy
* Use the grid to determine how to move the cluster forward into actionable columns on the Trello board 

\(1:20\) Re-assemble \(if in breakout groups\). The groups brief each other on what they’ve done. Consent to Trello cards action plans entered by each group.

### Closing round evaluation of meeting \(1:45\)

#### oral comments.

* Dean: Like to have Ada holder perspective on ideas moving forward
* Lauris: A bit slow. Want to discuss issues other groups have to understand deeper. Not sure of next steps.
* Felix: Lose time in discussing methods. More simple design up front. And you all are awesome. Value to listen to other points of view 
* Victor: Lost time discussing things we didn’t need, or didn’t have the overview to understand. Read agenda beforehand. What are expectations for next meeting, and end goal for the circle? Concrete
* Juli: Like different points of view, questioning, and challenging. More space to speak free, more-open conversation. Too slow. 
* Dor: A bit upset and impatient at times. More focus on achieving outcome, and less meta conversation. Less polish and on the clock. Rounds of consent takes too much time and feels mechanical. Might be more efficient ways to achieve it, rather than one by one. Eats time. More time at start of the Trello board and rationale and how it translates. More about outcomes than blind trust in the process. Want more upfront information, like the Trello board and its logic rather than guessing the intentions. Everybody here is incredible, and already a lot of progress.
* Lauris: I like the structure rounds of consent; a little time consuming but great. We’ll find the best method for this circle; guinea pigs.

### Reference: Ideas for other ways to analyse problem statements:

Create a grid with 2 axes and map the ideas to scales or grids. Examples of grids:

* Local -- Global
* Known -- Unknown
* Cynefin - four quadrants: simple, complicated, complex, chaotic

  Examples of scales:

* Emotional/Energetic Ranking of the statements
* 0 - No energy
* 1 - Intellectual interest
* 2 - Emotional interest
* 3 - High Emotional interest
* Importance, Criticality, Speed of Change: Sort the problem statements and identify the top 2 clusters. Top priority would be most important, critical, and urgent.
