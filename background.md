I started the initiative to organize the Catalyst Circle by approach in SPOCRA. After a couple of conversations, we prepared this paper \([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ODXMuQvKnI-06fdH-EbF7IiyabwhwyPmT7Lgc\_Mgh5c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ODXMuQvKnI-06fdH-EbF7IiyabwhwyPmT7Lgc_Mgh5c/edit?usp=sharing)\). 

SPOCRA offered to help with the process of approaching other community groups. After a hold put on that process, Dor and I generated the following strategy and aimed at organizing the first minimal CC \([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QbHZKwj\_7EUq5VRMEz8G6llyoEi8b2LVu2J-xOXx7t0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QbHZKwj_7EUq5VRMEz8G6llyoEi8b2LVu2J-xOXx7t0/edit?usp=sharing)\). 

That evolved into this definition of the CC \([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgyOWMvMEtM0nkrGutN8pgcWa3HtmEwhRZ4ZO-veF5g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IgyOWMvMEtM0nkrGutN8pgcWa3HtmEwhRZ4ZO-veF5g/edit?usp=sharing)\). 

For each of the groups that elected a representative in a Town Hall breakout room, we first described the process one week and asked candidates to nominate themselves - or they could nominate someone else. 

For example, here is Victor's self-nomination statement \([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yljGlYQbUpdWWOizhanzoJ\_p10v0\_UbW/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yljGlYQbUpdWWOizhanzoJ_p10v0_UbW/view?usp=sharing)\). 

We followed roughly a sociocracy election format in which attendees, proposed on a table who they proposed for representative. The facilitator \(me\) then based on all the discussion a name and did a round asking for consent. The funded proposers, IOG, and Cardano Foundation selected their CC representative via their own internal process. I can describe that process further if you wish. \(Note: consent decision making was used to build unity around the decision \(a key benefit of decentralized decision-making \[a downside of majority voting is that it may encourage the formation of factions\]\). I can provide more detail - but that is the outline of how the six members who attended CC meeting \#1 were identified. Meanwhile, we initiated a more complex process to identify a general Ada voters rep. I'll document that in the next message.
