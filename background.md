#### Transcription

I started the initiative to organize the Catalyst Circle by approach in SPOCRA. After a couple of conversations, we prepared this paper :

SPOCRA offered to help with the process of approaching other community groups. After a hold put on that process, Dor and I generated the following strategy and aimed at organizing the first minimal CC :

That evolved into this definition of the CC :

For each of the groups that elected a representative in a Town Hall breakout room, we first described the process one week and asked candidates to nominate themselves - or they could nominate someone else. 

For example, here is Victor's self-nomination statement

We followed roughly a sociocracy election format in which attendees, proposed on a table who they proposed for representative. The facilitator \(me\) then based on all the discussion a name and did a round asking for consent. The funded proposers, IOG, and Cardano Foundation selected their CC representative via their own internal process. I can describe that process further if you wish. \(Note: consent decision making was used to build unity around the decision \(a key benefit of decentralized decision-making \[a downside of majority voting is that it may encourage the formation of factions\]\). I can provide more detail - but that is the outline of how the six members who attended CC meeting \#1 were identified. Meanwhile, we initiated a more complex process to identify a general Ada voters rep. I'll document that in the next message.

Here is the plan we prepared for selecting the Ada voter's representative

Basically we sent out a request for nominations \(including self-nominations\) for people who would be willing to serve on a committee to select a representative. We received 39 nominations and then used a random number generator to select about 10 members of the committee. The committee met, interviewed nominated candidates, and selected Dean with Jordon as his back-up. The Committee then decided to keep meeting in order to support Dean. \(Jordon subsequently joined the Committee.\) 

Here are the Search Committee's meeting records:

The Search Committee is preparing to do another round of elections for a new Committee to select and support a new Ada voters' representative for the next CC. \(It is considering various options such as staggered terms to support continuity of the Committee's collective memory.\)
